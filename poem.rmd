## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July --  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,  


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In twilight's gentle, fading grace,  
The stars emerge, a sparkling chase.  
The moon, a silver crescent bright,  
Guides us through the tranquil night.  

A breeze, like whispers, stirs the trees,  
Their leaves dancing with such ease.  
Nature's symphony, a lullaby,  
As daylight bids the world goodbye.  

The river's song, a soothing stream,  
Reflects the stars in a tranquil gleam.  
In shadows cast by the silent night,  
Dreams take flight in soft moonlight.  

With each breath, a sigh of peace,  
All worldly troubles find release.  
In this moment, calm and still,  
The world's troubles, they do chill.  

Embrace the night, its quiet grace,  
Find solace in this sacred space.  
For in darkness, beauty's found,  
In this tranquil, hushed surround.
