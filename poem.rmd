In twilight's gentle, fading grace,  
The stars emerge, a sparkling chase.  
The moon, a silver crescent bright,  
Guides us through the tranquil night.  

A breeze, like whispers, stirs the trees,  
Their leaves dancing with such ease.  
Nature's symphony, a lullaby,  
As daylight bids the world goodbye.  

The river's song, a soothing stream,  
Reflects the stars in a tranquil gleam.  
In shadows cast by the silent night,  
Dreams take flight in soft moonlight.  

With each breath, a sigh of peace,  
All worldly troubles find release.  
In this moment, calm and still,  
The world's troubles, they do chill.  

Embrace the night, its quiet grace,  
Find solace in this sacred space.  
For in darkness, beauty's found,  
In this tranquil, hushed surround.
